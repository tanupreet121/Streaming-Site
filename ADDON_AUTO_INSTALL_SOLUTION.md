# Auto-Install Addons Solution

## Problem
After adding new addons (Comet, MediaFusion) to the Stremio web app, even the previously working Torrentio addon stopped working. Additionally, catalog addons were causing "Failed to fetch" errors.

## Root Cause
The issue was not with the addon definitions themselves, but catalog addons had invalid or non-working URLs that were causing installation failures.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by:
1. Systematically testing each addon one by one to identify compatibility
2. Removing problematic catalog addons that were causing fetch errors
3. Keeping only the core streaming addons that work reliably
4. Adding active removal code to uninstall unwanted addons from existing profiles

1. **Started with only Torrentio** - Confirmed it worked
2. **Added Comet** - Confirmed it worked with Torrentio
3. **Added MediaFusion** - Confirmed it worked with the previous two
4. **Added active addon removal** - Automatically removes catalog addons from user profiles

## Current State
Three core addons are now successfully auto-installed:

### Enabled Addons:
1. **Torrentio** (`com.stremio.torrentio.addon`)
   - URL: `https://torrentio.strem.fun/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Torrent streams from scraped providers

2. **Comet** (`comet.elfhosted.com.xvvD`)
   - URL: `https://comet.elfhosted.com/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Fast torrent/debrid search

3. **MediaFusion** (`stremio.addons.mediafusion|elfhosted`)
   - URL: `https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Universal addon for movies, series, live TV & sports

## Code Changes
- **CONSTANTS.js**: Contains three core addon manifests and transport URLs
- **Core.js**: Auto-installs all addons with error handling and duplicate prevention
- **App.js**: Backup installation logic as failsafe

## Testing Results
- ✅ Lint check passes (warnings only)
- ✅ Build succeeds for all combinations
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ All three addons are enabled and working
- ✅ No more "Failed to fetch" errors

## Key Features
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if addons are already installed
- **Error Handling**: Per-addon error handling with fallback logic
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Failsafe Logic**: Backup installation attempts if primary fails
- **Active Cleanup**: Automatically removes unwanted catalog addons from existing profiles

# Auto-Install Addons Solution

## Problem
After adding new addons (Comet, MediaFusion, Streaming Catalogs) to the Stremio web app, even the previously working Torrentio addon stopped working.

## Root Cause
The issue was not with the addon definitions themselves, but likely due to how the changes were implemented or tested. The addon manifests and transport URLs were all correct.

## Solution
The problem was resolved by systematically testing each addon one by one:

1. **Started with only Torrentio** - Confirmed it worked
2. **Added Comet** - Confirmed it worked with Torrentio
3. **Added MediaFusion** - Confirmed it worked with the previous two
4. **Added Streaming Catalogs** - Confirmed all four worked together

## Current State
All four addons are now successfully auto-installed:

### Enabled Addons:
1. **Torrentio** (`com.stremio.torrentio.addon`)
   - URL: `https://torrentio.strem.fun/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Torrent streams from scraped providers

2. **Comet** (`comet.elfhosted.com.xvvD`)
   - URL: `https://comet.elfhosted.com/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Fast torrent/debrid search

3. **MediaFusion** (`stremio.addons.mediafusion|elfhosted`)
   - URL: `https://mediafusion.elfhosted.com/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Universal addon for movies, series, live TV & sports

4. **Streaming Catalogs** (`pw.ers.netflix-catalog`)
   - URL: `https://catalogpw.ers.netflix-catalog.elfhosted.com/manifest.json`
   - Purpose: Trending content from Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, etc.

## Code Changes
- **CONSTANTS.js**: Contains all four addon manifests and transport URLs
- **Core.js**: Auto-installs all addons with error handling and duplicate prevention
- **App.js**: Backup installation logic as failsafe

## Testing Results
- ✅ Lint check passes (warnings only)
- ✅ Build succeeds for all combinations
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ All four addons are enabled and working

## Key Features
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if addons are already installed
- **Error Handling**: Per-addon error handling with fallback logic
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- **Failsafe Logic**: Backup installation attempts if primary fails

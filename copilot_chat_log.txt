# Copilot Chat Log - Torrentio Addon Auto-Install Fix

## Summary of the Fix

The Torrentio addon was not working despite being hardcoded. The following changes were made to ensure it is automatically installed and available:

### 1. Enhanced CONSTANTS.js
- Reformatted `TORRENTIO_ADDON_MANIFEST` to use proper JS object syntax.
- Created a `TORRENTIO_ADDON` object with both manifest and transportUrl.
- Exported both constants.

### 2. Core.js
- Imported `TORRENTIO_ADDON`.
- In `onTransportInit`, added logic to auto-install Torrentio after a 2s delay, only if not already installed.
- Added fallback logic and extensive logging for debugging.

### 3. App.js (not shown here, but part of the solution)
- Added a backup installation logic with a 5s delay as a failsafe.

### 4. Lint and Build
- Fixed lint issues and ensured the project builds cleanly.

## Copilot Chat Transcript

- User: torrentino addon is not working despite adding it via hardcoding
- Copilot: Investigated the codebase, found that the manifest was not being installed. Added logic to Core.js and App.js to auto-install the addon, with duplicate prevention and error handling. Added logging for debugging. Fixed lint and build issues. Provided a summary and test instructions.
- User: Continue: "Continue to iterate?"
- Copilot: Added backup logic in App.js, improved error handling, and ensured robust installation. Fixed more lint issues and confirmed build success.

Summary
The issue was that the Torrentio addon manifest was defined in CONSTANTS.js but it was never being automatically installed. I've implemented a comprehensive solution with multiple layers of redundancy:

Changes Made:
Enhanced CONSTANTS.js:

Reformatted the TORRENTIO_ADDON_MANIFEST to use proper JavaScript object syntax (instead of JSON)
Created a new TORRENTIO_ADDON object that includes both the manifest and the transport URL
Added proper exports for both constants
Modified Core.js:

Added import for TORRENTIO_ADDON from CONSTANTS
Enhanced onTransportInit() function to automatically install Torrentio addon
Added logic to check if the addon is already installed to prevent duplicates
Implemented fallback installation mechanism with error handling
Added a 2-second delay to ensure the core is fully initialized before attempting installation
Enhanced App.js:

Added backup installation logic in case the primary installation in Core.js fails
Created ensureTorrentioInstalled() function with proper error handling
Added a 5-second delay for the backup installation to avoid conflicts
Added comprehensive logging for debugging
How it works:
Primary Installation: When the Core transport initializes, it waits 2 seconds then checks if Torrentio is already installed. If not, it installs it automatically.

Backup Installation: When the App becomes active, it waits 5 seconds then performs a backup check and installation if needed.

Error Handling: Both installation attempts have try-catch blocks and fallback mechanisms.

Logging: Comprehensive console logging helps debug any issues.

Key Features:
Duplicate Prevention: Checks if addon is already installed before attempting installation
Error Resilience: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure installation succeeds
Timing Optimization: Uses delays to ensure core systems are ready
Debug Friendly: Extensive logging for troubleshooting
The solution ensures that the Torrentio addon will be automatically installed when the application starts, resolving the issue where it was hardcoded but not working.

To test this:

Start the development server: npm start
Open the browser console to see the installation logs
Check the addons page to verify Torrentio is installed
Try searching for content to verify streams are working
The build completed successfully, confirming the implementation is syntactically correct and should resolve the Torrentio addon installation issue.
